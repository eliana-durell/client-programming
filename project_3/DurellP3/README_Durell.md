I found a typerwriter animation online. I'm not sure if that counts.

I used the 6th codepen and edited it

I used
    Semantic UI - People --> tabs, card, modal, button
    Foundation Framework - Degrees --> accordion, Minors --> accordion, 
    JQuery UI - Minor --> tabs
    Datatables - Employment --> tables
